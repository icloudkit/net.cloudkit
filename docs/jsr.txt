92		Localizable Text
Description:		Localizable Text is the infrastructure necessary to translate language-neutral information (in an object) from anywhere in a distributed network.
Status:		Withdrawn
Reason:		Both JSR-92 and JSR-150 address the issue of 'distributed internationalization' in the J2EE world. JSR-92 is somewhat client-centric in nature while JSR-150 attempts to provide a server-side solution. The progress of JSR-92 is rather slow, and some of the issues raised in JSR-92 can be addressed more elegantly by the technology advocated in JSR-150. The existence of two separate JSRs for the same issue of distributed internationalization can generate unnecessary confusion. Hence we feel JSR-92 should be withdrawn from the JSR space altogether. We will incorporate relevant portions of JSR-92 in JSR-150.

126		Distributed Page Assembly
Description:		This specification defines a standard application model and architecture for distributed page assembly within the J2EE framework.
Status:		Withdrawn
Reason:		Initial discussions for the JSR 126 EG were deferred when they realized that a viable solution in the proposed direction, which is complimentary to JSR 128, required advancements in the underlying technology (Edge Side Includes). At the time, it seemed that discussion about ESI-related standards were sufficiently active that they could wait for the next version of the standard. However, those discussions seemed to stall as attentions were directed to early adoption and other topics. If ESI standards are revised at a later date, then perhaps the objectives of JSR 126 could be pursued through a new JSR.

189		JavaTM 3D API 1.4
Description:		This JSR will add new large scale funtionality to Java 3D. Possible technologies for inclusion include programmable shading and advanced rendering techniques.
Status:		Withdrawn
Reason:		The changes to the Java 3D API as originally envisioned by JSR-189 were quite significant, and were planned as part of a major API release, for which we had planned to form an expert group under the JSR. Due to changes in the nature of the project development, this effort was discontinued in 2002, a few months after the JSR was filed. JSR-189 was left open as a place-holder, but it no longer makes sense to leave it open. At the time of withdrawal, the Java 3D API was a community source project on java.net, where all new development had happened over the past 18 months. They were actively developing the 1.4 API release with help from the Java 3D community on java.net. This release was a much more modest undertaking than was originally planned, and all new API changes are being designed with public input. As such they closed this JSR, and did Java 3D 1.4 as a maintenance release under the JCP.

358		A major revision of the Java Community Process
Description:		This JSR will make a variety of changes and adjustments to the Java Community Process, revising the Process Document, the EC Standing Rules, and the JSPA.
Status:		Withdrawn
Reason:		At the January 2016 meeting of the JCP Executive Committee (EC) the EC was informed that Oracle Legal had advised that no changes should be made to the JSPA or to JSR licensing models while litigation is ongoing (see the public minutes for more details).

Consequently the EC decided at the March meeting to withdraw (close) JSR 358. Another JSR ('JCP.next.5') will be opened to work on changes that can be implemented by modifying only the Process Document, and we hope and expect that we will be able to pick up the more substantive changes that were being considered for JSR 358 as soon as the litigation is completed.
